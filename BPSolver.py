class BPSolver:
    """
    Board Puzzle Solver

    Finds a solution to a board puzzle by testing possible moves and making deductions. A board puzzle requires placing objects
    while meeting certain rules or restrictions. For example, a chess board where you need to arrange certain pieces,
    or a grid where you need to put numbers, tiles, characters, etc., with some restrictions.

    This class takes an object of a class that implements the abstract class BoardPuzzle and searches for a solution.
    So all you need to provide is the board object.

    The strategy is:
        1) When it's possible to deduct some mandatory moves from the current board position, make them.
        2) When you cannot repeat step 1 anymore, make a guess and try your best moveâ€”the one most likely to lead to a
        solution quickly. Then go to step 1 from here.
        3) If that leads you to a dead end, return to the previous position and make a new guess.

    The more efficiently the puzzle object implements its methods, the higher the probability of finding a solution.
    For example, if you can detect dead-end paths early, you can dramatically cut the search tree. The more deductions
    you can make to generate mandatory moves, the less you'll need to make guesses. You can also control the order of
    the search by controlling the order in which the guess moves are tried from a given board position.
